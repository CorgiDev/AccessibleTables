# Accessible Tables
A workshop on making accessible tables as an introduction to accessibility using the **Badges and Certifications** table on my personal [Resume page](https://corgidev.com/resume.html) as an example. 

The `start.html` file shows the table and base html at its most basic. While the `end.html` file shows it once it has been made more Accessible.
